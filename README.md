# Project 1

I spent so long trying to figure out why none of my css was doing anything
when I was mispelled the css file path in the html file...

Question: A lot of times I'll make small changes to a bunch of different files that are somewhat unrelated and add/commit them all with the same message. Should I be adding and commiting these files separately so that their messages make more sense?
