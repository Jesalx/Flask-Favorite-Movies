## Technical Issues

1. One technical issue that I encountered in this project was that I would keep adding updates to the webpage CSS, but nothing was changing. At first I thought I was just making mistakes in my CSS, but eventually realized that I had a typo in the CSS path when linking in the HTML file.
2. Another technical issue that caused me a lot of trouble was converting a Wikipedia page id into a working Wikipedia URL. I spent a lot of time looking at the Wikipedia API without success. I'm sure there is still a method using the API, but I haven't found it. I eventually found that you could pass the page id as a query parameter to Wikipeida to get to the page as a simpler method rather than using the API.
